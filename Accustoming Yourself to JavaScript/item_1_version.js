JavaScript has evolved significantly over time, and its journey from being
a complement to Java for creating interactive web pages to becoming the
dominant web programming language is a remarkable one.
This transformation eventually led to the formalization of JavaScript
as an international standard known as ECMAScript in 1997.
Today, there are numerous implementations of JavaScript that adhere to
various versions of the ECMAScript standard.

The third edition of the ECMAScript standard, commonly referred to as ES3, 
was finalized in 1999 and remains one of the most widely adopted versions of
JavaScript. The next major milestone in JavaScript's evolution was Edition 5,
or ES5, released in 2009. ES5 introduced several new features while also 
standardizing previously unspecified but widely supported ones.

For example, ES5 introduced the `const` keyword for defining variables. 
However, it's important to note that the ECMAScript standard didn't provide 
a definition for the syntax or behavior of `const`, and its behavior can vary
between different JavaScript implementations. Some implementations prevent
updating `const` variables, while others treat `const` as a synonym for `var`.

With JavaScript's long history and diverse implementations, it can be 
challenging to keep track of which features are available on which platform.
This complexity is compounded by the fact that web browsers, 
where JavaScript is primarily used, do not offer programmers control over 
the JavaScript version available for executing their code. As a result, web 
programs need to be written carefully to work consistently across all browsers.

However, JavaScript is not limited to client-side web programming; 
it has applications in server-side programs, browser extensions, and mobile 
and desktop applications scripting. In these cases, you may have access to 
more specific versions of JavaScript tailored to the platform's implementation.

This book primarily focuses on the standard features of JavaScript. But it's 
also important to be aware of widely supported nonstandard features. 
When dealing with newer standards or nonstandard features, it's crucial to 
understand whether your applications will run in environments that support 
those features to prevent issues when deploying your code in different
environments.

ES5 introduced another versioning consideration with its strict mode, which
allows you to opt into a restricted version of JavaScript, disallowing some
problematic or error-prone features of the language. You can enable strict
mode by adding the special string constant `"use strict"` at the beginning
of your program or a function. However, it's worth noting that older
JavaScript engines may not perform strict-mode checks.

One pitfall of using strict mode is that the `"use strict"` directive is only
recognized at the top of a script or function. This makes it sensitive to script
concatenation, which is often used to combine separate files into a single file 
for deployment.

To address the concatenation challenge, there are a few alternatives:
1. Avoid concatenating strict and nonstrict files, which simplifies the process
    but limits control over your file structure.
2. Concatenate files by wrapping their contents in immediately invoked function
    expressions (IIFEs). This approach allows each file to be interpreted 
    independently in different modes.
3. Write your files to behave the same way in either strict or nonstrict mode
    by wrapping the contents of all your code in functions that enable strict
    mode locally.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your code is compatible with a
wide range of contexts and avoid issues related to strict mode and concatenation.

JavaScript has continued to evolve beyond ES5, with significant improvements and
new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and subsequent versions in 7/6/2015.
These advancements have further expanded JavaScript's capabilities, making it even
more versatile and powerful for various programming tasks.

For example, ES6 introduced features like `let` and `const` for variable 
declarations, arrow functions, classes, template literals, and destructuring
assignments, among others. These features have simplified and enhanced JavaScript
code, making it more readable and maintainable.

Here's an example of ES6 code using `const`:

```
javascript
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = "modified!"; // This will result in an error
console.log(PI); // 3.141592653589793
```

And here's an example of an ES6 arrow function:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

As JavaScript continues to evolve, it's essential to stay up to date with the
latest features and best practices to make the most of this versatile language
for your web and application development needs.
